<p>Knowledge Today is a small, upcoming organisation that works with colleges such as City of Westminster college to raise awareness about certain, yet serious topics such as fake news and other topics. We aim to empower people with knowledge to ensure that they can benefit society the correct way, instead of being swayed by circumstances they do not know about.  

Right now, we are working to empower students at City of Westminster college. This is one of the best colleges in London, based in Paddington, west London. It offers many different courses to people of all ages, whether you are a young student looking to go into further education, or an adult looking to work in a different sector, this college is for you! When creating this website, we decided the purpose to be something we felt passionate about. Looking around, we can see that our young people are majorly affected by the constantly bombardment or social media and their studies that we often forget their need to educate themselves on world events. Our young people are proven to be the least knowledgeable when it comes to the news and world events. Fake news being one of the topics that will be talked about on our website is another major issue for both young people and older people, and the media is to blame for portraying world events in ways that may be used to sway the public's opinions. We aim to empower our younger people and ensure that everyone is knowledgeable of many world events and topics. The list above is a sample of the topics covered, free to the public and ready to be explored!</p>
<h3>Who we target:</h3>
<p>Often, we look to empower the younger generation for many reasons. These reasons include younger people being surrounded by so much knowledge and information that the youth can find it hard to distinguish real from fake, and this is especially prevalent when talking about the news. There is so much false information being spread across the news and on the media that people can lose track of what is going on. This way, creating an organisation as a college that aims to empower the youth will have the best effect. 

We especially tend to target students of any ethnicity and gender who are studying Media or Politics as we aim to create a future where our people are receiving the right news and are well equipped with knowledge regarding what is happening in the world. By strengthening media student knowledge, there will be less fake news coverage circulating, and by strengthening politics studentsâ€™ knowledge, we raise good politicians who will do well for our countries.</p>
